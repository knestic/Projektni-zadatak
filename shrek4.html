    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Years ago, King Harold and Queen Lillian were going to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin ("Rumpel"), in exchange for lifting the curse of their daughter, Princess Fiona, who was cursed as a child to become an ogre nightly, and was locked in a tower until her "true love" could rescue her. However, the deal is cancelled when they're informed that she's been saved. Rumpel laments his loss and wishes that Fiona's rescuer, Shrek, was never born.
      In the present, Shrek has grown tired of being a family man and celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy, and Rumpel has since become an outcast. While celebrating his children's first birthday at a restaurant in Far Far Away, an escalating series of events causes Shrek to walk out in anger and lash out at Fiona. Having seen the outburst, Rumpel follows Shrek into the forest and invites him into his carriage. Inside Rumpel's carriage, Shrek laments that he is no longer a "real ogre", so Rumpel offers him a deal to receive a day as a "real ogre" in exchange for a day from his past. Shrek signs a contract fulfilling this wish, and is taken to an alternate reality.

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>Following the success of Shrek 2, a third and fourth Shrek film, along with plans for a fifth and final film, were announced in May 2004 by Jeffrey Katzenberg. In October 2006, DreamWorks Animation revealed that the fourth film would be released in 2010.

      In October 2007, Katzenberg announced a title for the fourth film, Shrek Goes Fourth, explaining that "Shrek goes out into the world, forth!" In May 2009, however, DreamWorks Animation retitled the film to Shrek Forever After, indicating that it would be the last in the Shrek series. In November 2009, Bill Damaschke, head of creative production at DreamWorks Animation, confirmed with "All that was loved about Shrek in the first film is brought to the final film."
      
      Tim Sullivan was hired to write the script in March 2005, but was later replaced by Darren Lemke and Josh Klausner. Klausner, about the script's evolution, said, "When I first came onto the project, it wasn't supposed to be the final chapter, there were originally going to be 5 Shrek movies. Then, about a year into the development, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the story that we'd come up with was the right way for Shrek's journey to end, which was incredibly flattering." In May 2007, shortly before the release of the third film, it was announced Mike Mitchell would be on board to direct the new installment. Much of the film was written and recorded in New York City.</p>
